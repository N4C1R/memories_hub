## How to Add New Memories

1.  **Add Photo:**
    *   Place your photo file (e.g., `my-photo.jpg`) into the `images/` folder.

2.  **Add Description:**
    *   Open `memories.json`.
    *   Add a new entry to the list like this:
        ```json
        {
          "image": "my-photo.jpg",
          "description": "A wonderful day! ❤️",
          "date": "2023-10-27"
        }
        ```
    *   Make sure to add a comma `,` after the previous entry if it's not the last one.

3.  **Done!**
    *   Refresh the page to see the new memory.
